Computer security, cyber security, digital security or information technology security <b>(IT security)</b> is the protection of computer systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
<br><br>The field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Also, due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the <b>Internet of things (IoT).</b>

<h3><mark>Computer security threats are possible dangers that can possibly hamper the normal functioning of your computer. In the present age, cyber threats are constantly increasing as the world is going digital. The most harmful types of computer security are:</mark></h3>

<b>VIRUSES : </b>
<img src="https://www.missioncriticalmagazine.com/ext/resources/images/2020/Virus-main.jpg?1598279083" width="80" height="80" align="left">
A computer virus is a malicious program which is loaded into the users computer without users knowledge. It replicates itself and infects the files and programs on the users PC. The ultimate goal of a virus is to ensure that the victims computer will never be able to operate properly or even at all. 

<br><br><br><br>

<b> COMPUTER WORM : </b>
<img src="https://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what-is-a-computer-worm_07.jpg" width="80" height="80" align="left">
A computer worm is a software program that can copy itself from one computer to another, without human interaction. The potential risk here is that it will use up your computer hard disk space because a worm can replicate in greate volume and with great speed.

<br><br><br><br>

<b> PHISHING : </b>
<img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/phishing_scams_-_article_image.jpg" width="80" height="80" align="left">
Disguising as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages. Phishing in unfortunately very easy to execute. You are deluded into thinking its the legitimate mail and you may enter your personal information.

<br><br><br><br>

<b> PHISHING : </b>
<img src="https://ithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Botnets.png" width="80" height="80" align="left">
A botnet is a group of computers connected to the internet, that have been compromised by a hacker using a computer virus. An individual computer is called zombie computer. The result of this threat is the victims computer, which is the bot will be used for malicious activities and for a larger scale attack like DDoS.

Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data.<br>
Artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations have made data processing faster and more efficient. Industry demand has created an ecosystem of courses, degrees, and job positions within the field of data science. Because of the cross-functional skillset and expertise required, data science shows strong projected growth over the coming decades.

<h3>Data science is used to study data in four main ways:</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Descriptive analysis:</b></u>Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Diagnostic analysis:</b></u>Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Predictive analysis:</b></u>Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. Having anticipated their customers future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising for those cities from February.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Prescriptive analysis:</b></u>Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning.  </li></ul>

A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server.A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (Front-end web development), server-side applications (back-end development), or both (full-stack development).
There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on JavaScript.

<h3><mark>though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have knowledge and skills such as:</mark></h3>
<ul type="disc"><li>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript[1]</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>Understanding server-side/client-side architecture and communication of the kind mentioned above</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li>Ability to utilize a database[2]</li></ul><br>


 <h3>The Different Types Of Web Development : </h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Front-end web development--></b></u>Front-end web development is responsible for the look and feel of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone. Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make sure websites are optimized for users and search engines and with security best practices in mind.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Back-end web development--></b></u>Back-end web development is responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming languages include Java (different from JavaScript), PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang. Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking communities that share coding tips and support.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Full-stack web development--></b></u>Full-stack web development covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending on the complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development, from the server side to the user interface. Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a build or redesign. Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen websites business capabilities.</li></ul> 


<h3>SKILLS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS : </h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Programming abilities--></b></u> Strong coding skills are essential. Mastering programming languages such as HTML and CSS is just a start. Technology changes fast, so a willingness to always be learning new coding techniques is important. </li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Attention to detail--></b></u>Testing and debugging code requires patience and analytical skills to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Creative thinking--></b></u>Successful websites have to attract and keep users, as well as be visible to search engines. Web developers have to be creative in how they pull together user experience, search engine optimization, and other factors in building a good site.</li></ul>

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.[1] Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains.[2] In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.[3]
<b>Data mining</b> is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information.[4] In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics

<h3>Types of Data Analysis:</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Descriptive Analysis:</b></u>Descriptive analysis involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It focuses on organizing and presenting the data in a meaningful way, often using measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. It provides an overview of the data and helps identify patterns or trends.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Inferential Analysis:</b></u>Inferential analysis aims to make inferences or predictions about a larger population based on sample data. It involves applying statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. It helps generalize findings from a sample to a larger population.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b></u>EDA focuses on exploring and understanding the data without preconceived hypotheses. It involves visualizations, summary statistics, and data profiling techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and interesting features. It helps generate hypotheses for further analysis.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Diagnostic Analysis:</b></u>Diagnostic analysis aims to understand the cause-and-effect relationships within the data. It investigates the factors or variables that contribute to specific outcomes or behaviors. Techniques such as regression analysis, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), or correlation analysis are commonly used in diagnostic analysis.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Predictive Analysis:</b></u>Predictive analysis involves using historical data to make predictions or forecasts about future outcomes. It utilizes statistical modeling techniques, machine learning algorithms, and time series analysis to identify patterns and build predictive models. It is often used for forecasting sales, predicting customer behavior, or estimating risk.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Prescriptive Analysis: </b></u>Prescriptive analysis goes beyond predictive analysis by recommending actions or decisions based on the predictions. It combines historical data, optimization algorithms, and business rules to provide actionable insights and optimize outcomes. It helps in decision-making and resource allocation.</li></ul> 


<h3>Data Analysis Process:</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Requirement Gathering:</b></u>Ask yourself why you are doing this analysis, what type of data you want to use, and what data you plan to analyze.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Collection:</b></u>Guided by your identified requirements, its time to collect the data from your sources. Sources include case studies, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, direct observation, and focus groups. Make sure to organize the collected data for analysis.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Cleaning:</b></u>Not all of the data you collect will be useful, so its time to clean it up. This process is where you remove white spaces, duplicate records, and basic errors. Data cleaning is mandatory before sending the information on for analysis.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Analysis:</b></u>Here is where you use data analysis software and other tools to help you interpret and understand the data and arrive at conclusions. Data analysis tools include Excel, Python, R, Looker, Rapid Miner, Chartio, Metabase, Redash, and Microsoft Power BI.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Interpretation:</b></u>Now that you have your results, you need to interpret them and come up with the best courses of action based on your findings.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Data Visualization:</b></u>Data visualization is a fancy way of saying, graphically show your information in a way that people can read and understand it. You can use charts, graphs, maps, bullet points, or a host of other methods. Visualization helps you derive valuable insights by helping you compare datasets and observe relationships.</li></ul>

The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex taskssuch as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great proficiency.<BR><br>
Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.


<h3>Type of Artificial Intelligence :</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Weak AI/Narrow AI :</b></u>Weak artificial intelligence (AI) also called narrow AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area. Weak AI simulates human cognition. It has the potential to benefit society by automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways that humans sometimes can't. Weak AI can be contrasted to strong AI, a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. </li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Strong AI :</b></u>Strong artificial intelligence (strong AI) is an artificial intelligence construct that has mental capabilities and functions that mimic the human brain. In the philosophy of strong AI, there is no essential difference between the piece of software, which is the AI, exactly emulating the actions of the human brain, and actions of a human being, including its power of understanding and even its consciousness.</li></ul> 


<h3>Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language:</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Learning:</b></u>SThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures known as rote learning is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. </li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Reasoning:</b></u>To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either deductive or inductive. An example of the former is, Fred must be in either the museum or the caf. He is not in the caf; therefore he is in the museum, and of the latter, Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure. The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Problem Solving:</b></u>Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis a step-by-step, or incremental, reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means in the case of a simple robot this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT until the goal is reached.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Perception:</b></u>In perception the environment is scanned by means of various sensory organs, real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding field.</li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Language:</b></u>A language is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to the spoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini-language, it being a matter of convention that ? means hazard ahead in some countries. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called natural meaning, exemplified in statements such as Those clouds mean rain and The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning.</li></ul> 


<h3>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence :</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>Increased Efficiency:</b></u>AI can automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and productivity in various industries. </li></ul> 

<ul type="disc"><li><b><u>24/7 Availability: </b></u>AI-powered systems can operate continuously, offering round-the-clock services and support.</li></ul>
