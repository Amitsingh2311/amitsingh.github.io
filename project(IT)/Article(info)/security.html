<p>Information technology (IT) security management can be defined as a process that enables organizational structure and technology to protect an organization's IT operations and assets against internal and external threats, intentional or otherwise. The principal purpose of IT security management is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IT systems. Fundamentally, security management is a part of the risk management process and business continuity strategy in an organization.<br>
IT security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets such as computers, networks, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of sophisticated hackers.<br>
Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It involves the protection of information systems and the information processed, stored and transmitted by these systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. This includes the protection of personal information, financial information, and sensitive or confidential information stored in both digital and physical forms. Effective information security requires a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach, involving people, processes, and technology.

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Network Security</u></font></h3>Whether you have a small office space or a large headquarters, your computers and other devices are most likely tied to a network. (It’s 2023, after all.) This helps your team communicate internally more easily – but it also opens you up to external threats.

Targeted cyber attacks and malware can slip through your network security if you’re not monitoring your network and infrastructure. Having the right technology—such as firewalls and antivirus programs—to prevent these attacks lays a great foundation to your security.

You can also implement a company-wide security program that includes multi-factor authentication, frequently refreshing passwords, monitored internet access, and other safety measures to get your employees involved. It can be tedious, but they’ll take some ownership of your company’s security measures. There’s no “i” in “team,” but there is in IT.

Some of my favorite companies' network devices to work with for Network Security are Cisco for larger companies and SonicWALL for small businesses. I also like to work with Acronis Cyber Protection for end-user Malware and ransomware protection.  </li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Cloud Security</u></font></h3>When you use cloud-based platforms and data storage programs, you should choose a reputable supplier. For example, Google Cloud has security tools built into their platform. As more and more businesses use cloud-based platforms—especially as working from home becomes more popular—businesses should know what their responsibility is versus the provider’s responsibility.

Using the Google Cloud example, Google would have a safe infrastructure and access to their physical hosts and network to patch or configure any issues that arise. On the other hand, businesses that use Google Cloud would have to be aware of who has access to the cloud, ensure that no one could gain unauthorized access, and secure cloud-based data assets.

When it comes to protecting your cloud systems, we must use tools that function outside of your organization. We often recommend Acronis Cloud Protect. We also often suggest using tools like the single sign-on capability of Jump Cloud to provide 2FA across all cloud applications.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Application Security</u></font></h3>Cyber threats? There’s an app for that. And that app is … literally any application that you use. App developers build in security measures during design and development. So it’s important to use apps from trusted brands, whether you’re accessing them from your network or the cloud.

For example, one of the biggest security threats to businesses is email. Neutralizing and minimizing risks within email applications are key to having a healthy business. One click on a bad link could Thanos-snap your company into chaos.

There are ways you can add extra safeguards when using apps within your business. First, take stock of where you are using apps: on the web, from the cloud, on your phone, etc. Then be sure to add safety measures like virtual private networks (VPNs), a web application firewall, and cloud access only for those who need it.

Securing applications is just as important as network security. Not sharing user account or passwords is critical. Implementing multiform authentication helps as does a third-party SSL certificate.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Internet of Things Security</u></font></h3>Your laptop that you take to meetings. Your phone that you use for Slack and calling clients. The printer you sent a memo to. Your Wi-Fi router that needs unplugged and plugged back in every once in a while. These are a few of the “things” make up the internet of things (IoT). If you’ve tethered a device to your network, it opens a portal for potential security threats.

Threats can come in at any point in the IoT journey. It is important to conduct a security risk assessment to find vulnerabilities in your network system and devices. This assessment should look at everything from web code to policy management and users. There are many layers within IoT, and that amount grows as your business grows. Don’t wait to ramp up your security.

We partner with and recommend Secureframe. They help us stay up to date to offer PCI, Soc2, and HIPPA compliance for our customers. It is important to have a partner that can stay up to day with the ever-changing horizon of cyber security.</li></ul>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importance of Monitoring Security Measures</h3>
<p>Having security measures in place is great. But what happens when someone discovers a threat? Do you even have anyone dedicated to reviewing potential threats? This would be like installing a doorbell at home so the people from Publishers Clearing House can ring it. Yet if you’re not home, you won’t be able to answer the door and greet them. But let’s say you do answer – you will still have to take additional steps beyond posing with a giant check to get your cash.

Speaking of cash… Many businesses tend to shy away from strong security measures because of the time and money it takes. They do the bare minimum and hope for the best. However, when something bad happens, they regret not investing earlier in their security.

At The Karcher Group, we have a dedicated team of network administrators, security pros, and web developers. This crew can greatly improve your business IT services and security. For example, <mark>we provide hosted backup and security that enables you to offer more thorough cyber protection for your business without increasing your management burden.</mark>

We also use industry-recognized software to scan your website. Our security-trained experts review the results and recommend remediation steps in line with your risk assessment. Again, this part is key. You have to have someone in place, looking at the data, ready to squash any threats.</p>
