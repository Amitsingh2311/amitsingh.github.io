<p>Education and learning are never-ending processes, and it does not have its  limit on when to start and stop. Every day we learn new things that help us in the progress of our lifestyle. Information comes from education, and we use the gathered information for our usage. Education should get accessed  at any time by everyone so that a working person, a homemaker, etc., can read  any time as per convenience . It will help in reducing the rate of illiteracy. Information Technology fastens the delivery of information, so it is perfect for improving the educational environment. Accessing cost on study material has reduced with the implementation of Information Technology. This technology is a boon to all as learning can be done from anywhere sitting in the world.</p><br><br>
<h4>The way of learning and the process of teaching have changed because of new technology. For achieving the specific academic goals, both teachers and students are utilizing these novel educational technologies.</h4></p><hr>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Plenty of Educational Resources</u></font></h3> Information technology has made academic information easily accessible at any time.  Both teachers and students are using IT to gather and exchange the study material. For example, teachers are providing audio-visual classes to their students by using computers and broadband internet. This breaks the boundaries of accessing information, as the student will be able to attend a lecture without making their physical presence in the classroom. In addition, it enables teachers to assign tasks to students through electronic mail or educational forums.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Instant access to educational information</u></font></h3> IT fastens the transfer and distribution of information. Students can easily access academic data by making usage of technologies like computers, mobile phone applications. Educational applications have been coded by the IT experts for students’ use so that they can access the information fast.  These apps are replacing old school things such as borrowing books from libraries, but nowadays, students are accessing library apps on their mobile phones with the help of IT. They can download e-books from the e-library and can read them anytime and anywhere. In this way, it saves time for the student to go to the library and to search and receive books.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Full-time learning</u></font></h3> The whole scenario has changed from the past. In the previous time, the learning was limited, but now it has broken the barriers. Now it’s not like students and teachers could only access the classroom for learning, but any of them can access academic information anytime. It hardly matters that where they are or what time is! IT has played a significant role in education by facilitating online education. Globalization is on height as on any educational forum students are studying globally. For example, you will find a student of Africa, the USA, and India in an online class doing the same course.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Group Learning</u></font></h3>Information Technology has helped students learn in the groups and it has also helped teachers teach students in groups.  In the past, we used to organize GDs at schools or institutes in which all participated members need to contribute, but the shy students stay away from these groups because they fear expressing themselves. So schools have created academic forums with the help of IT. Here, students can discuss a specific topic without fear of expression and involve themselves in video and text chatting. Another benefit of these online GD is that participants are from the same class or school and various schools globally. For example student from a nation like India, Africa is joining group discussions of students at Cambridge University.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Use of Audio – Visual</u></font></h3>As a result of technological advancements, learning and perceiving data has shifted. Students learn faster and more efficiently when audio-visual means are used for education. Students are bored in this type of schooling, as opposed to text and chalkboard notes. It is a human flaw that individuals do not want to read the text for extended periods because they become bored. Thus the use of audio-visual technology in the classroom allows pupils to learn more effectively.  Because some of these visuals are interesting and look familiar to a student, visual illustration employing images on projectors helps students understand the subject. Graphic drawings are more accessible for our brains to remember than words. This helps to explain why you can recall someone’s face but not their name.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Long Distance learning</u></font></h3>Students can learn from anywhere in the world thanks to technological advancements. It was made possible by the widespread availability of low-cost broadband internet in both developed and developing countries. Unlike in the past, when some courses were only available in wealthy countries, students had to go through the bother of moving from their native land, which was prohibitively expensive. These courses are now available online for students. In addition, many colleges have made their educational curricula available to the rest of the world. As a result, a student can become a member of that university for a nominal cost. Furthermore, these kids take the same examinations and have the same teachers grade them.</li></ul>
