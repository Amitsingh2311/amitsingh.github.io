<p>Many employers use Internet technologies to advertise job openings. Job seekers visit a company's website or a job bank database to read descriptions about available positions. People can take advantage of applying for jobs and submitting resumes online, for several openings, in one sitting.<br>
Many organizations fear that using technology in the workplace will only cause employees to waste time on social media and games when they should be working. However, it is not so. Technology is a blessing for the modern-day workplace. It makes it easier for employees to improve their productivity by focusing on important tasks. <mark> Using technology in the workplace not only impacts employee productivity. It also gives employees a medium to share their opinions, reduces unnecessary leaves, and improves teamwork, manager-employee communication, and employee satisfaction. </mark>This impacts the organization's profits in a positive way which, in the long run, improves employee engagement. Now, there are some ways in which you can utilize technology to improve employee satisfaction and level of engagement in the workplace.

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Working</u></font></h3> Technology has changed some careers and professions in ways that benefit the employer and the employee. For example, the early days of car manufacturing involved a mechanical assembly line that required a great deal of manual human labor. However, as of this article's publication, many car makers use a combination of robotic machines and man to help produce a final product. Robots not only increase the quality and efficiency in making the automobile, but factory workers might suffer less bodily injury from prolonged and repetitive actions. Car factory workers are being retrained to monitor and calibrate the robots that perform some of the most complicated and physically taxing aspects of the assembly process.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Competing</u></font></h3> Employees -- sometimes called human capital -- are a key asset in business operations. However, people do have mental and physical limits that can inhibit a business's ability to leverage that human talent to compete with other organizations. Take the example of packaging warehouses. Most employees can lift light boxes, repeatedly, of about 1 pound of less, if proper procedure is used. However, handling boxes of heavier and varying weights, maybe 10 to 20 pounds, might challenge many people. Instead, businesses can take advantage of technology, such as forklifts and conveyor belts, to help employees better manage products, faster and harder, than competitors. Online marketplaces have been able to gain retail market share from locally based stores by using this distribution center technology.</li></ul>

Job seekers visit a company's website or a job bank database to read descriptions about available positions. People can take advantage of applying for jobs and submitting resumes online, for several openings, in one sitting.</mark> Employers can screen applications and resumes for the people that best match key words relating to the job opening, minimizing unproductive and unfruitful face-to-face application and resume submissions.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Transforming</u></font></h3>On a grand scale, technology can positively change the world at an exponential, breakneck pace. Ray Kurzweil, author of "The Singularity Is Near," states on the book's website that the 21st century will be one of the most transformational in recorded human history, mostly due to technological advances that compound on one another. The advantage of technology on employment is that it has the potential to get better for both businesses and workers, as new innovations emerge that transform the way we work. Gary Shapiro, is the president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association in the U.S., and he penned a book in 2011, titled, "The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream." The book publisher's website suggests that technological innovation helps create new jobs, markets and industries that never existed before.</li></ul>
