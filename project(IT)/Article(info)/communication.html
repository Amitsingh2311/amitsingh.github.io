<p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand and manipulate information.<br>
 There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone networks with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning. ICT also includes analog technology, such as paper communication, and any mode that transmits communication.</p><hr>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Phone</u></font></h3>The phone is one of the core communication technologies that most professionals have readily available. You might use a landline phone in your office, a smartphone while traveling and internet calling while on your computer. Most phones have communication features that go beyond sending and receiving voice calls, including voicemail, conference calling and recording capabilities. Smartphones allow you to perform basic work duties as well if you have an available internet connection, such as writing emails, posting on social media and reviewing documents.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Email</u></font></h3> One of the most popular forms of communication technology is email. For decades, people have been using email to send messages and files over the internet. Unlike traditional mail, email arrives in the recipient's mailbox almost instantly. You might use email throughout the day to communicate with colleagues or clients, send and receive invoices and share text or photo files quickly and easily.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Blogs</u></font></h3> Blogs are websites where people can share content, or posts, for other people to read. Blogs can be publicly available to anyone with the website link or only accessible behind with a membership. Individuals can use personal blogs to share information about their hobbies and lives. Some gain enough popularity to earn money from advertising and partnerships. Companies can use blogs to grow their brands and gain publicity. Blogs might include not only text but also images, videos, infographics, links and advertising.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Social media</u></font></h3>Social media platforms, the earliest of which launched at the end of the 20th century, allow users to share their experiences and opinions with a worldwide audience. They also make it easy for people to communicate with other users on each platform. Today, most professionals and companies have corporate social media accounts they use for branding, marketing and communication. Through these platforms, they can share business or product updates, engage with and grow their audiences and stream videos and presentations.</li></ul>

<br><br>
<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Vlogs</u></font></h3>Vlogs are "video logs" that are basically visual versions of blogs. Rather than posting text, vloggers upload simple videos of themselves sharing their ideas or explaining how to do something. Vloggers typically use the camera on their computer or device or a handheld camera to record themselves saying or doing things. </li></ul>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use vlogs to:</h4>
<ol type="I"> <li>Increase brand awareness</li>
<li>Grow your following</li>
<li>Engage with your audience</li>
<li>Monetize your content</li>
<li>Share product launches and business updates</li>
</ol>

<ul type="disc"><li><h3><font color="#696969"><u>Podcasts</u></font></h3>Podcasts are audio-based forms of communication. Creators can record themselves disucssing a topic or telling a story, then upload and store the audio online. Audiences can download the podcast to listen to on their devices. Successful podcasts are often those that focus on a specific topic that has a dedicated audience, such as crime or politics. One feature that makes podcasts so popular is listeners can download and listen to them whenever they want. You can use a podcast to discuss a topic you're an expert on or to promote your brand.</li></ul>
